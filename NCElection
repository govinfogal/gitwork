What is happening with the North Carolina?

Currently the race in North Carolina's 9th Congressional District is under investigation.
Initially, the Republican candidate, Mark Harris, led the Democrat, Dan McCready, by 905 votes. But then it came to light that the Harris campaign had agreed to pay over $34,000 to a political consultant to conduct the fraudulent door-to-door operation.

North Carolina authorities are still investigating. Even Republicans are annoyed, because there is the possibility that Harris used similar dirty tricks to defeat his opponent in the Republican primary, and efforts are underway to dump Harris in favor of a less tainted Republican candidate.

State officials will almost surely order a new election. If Harris is somehow certified as the winner, the incoming House Democrats will refuse to seat him. Either way, the election is likely to get a do-over.

This brand of election fraud is in line with a long history of Republican dirty tricks, winding back to Richard Nixon’s “ballot security” program run by William Rehnquist in Arizona in 1964, aimed at intimidating black and Latino voters, long before Rehnquist was elevated to the Supreme Court.

The history of state officials, mostly in the South, using hazing techniques  ranging from bogus exams to murder to deprive black Americans of the right to vote, connects the Jim Crow era to new tricks legalized by the Supreme Court after the court invalidated major sections of the Voting Rights Act in the 5-4 Shelby County v. Holder ruling of 2013.

So, here is a modest proposal. Republicans have demanded a crackdown on voting fraud, in the name of safeguarding democracy. But taking away someone’s vote improperly is every bit as fraudulent and every bit as much an assault on democratic rights as voting improperly.

And while cases of improper voting are vanishingly rare, cases of improperly blocking the right to vote are pervasive. What’s worse, denial of the franchise is typically perpetrated by public officials who have the full force of the law on their side.

And when Congress does reinstate the Voting Rights Act, the new law should include criminal penalties for denying someone’s right to vote. Republicans, given their profound concern for the integrity of the electoral process, should vote for this provision unanimously.
